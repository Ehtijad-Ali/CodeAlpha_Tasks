# ✨ WordPress FAQ Chatbot

An intelligent and interactive FAQ chatbot designed to help users quickly find answers to common WordPress-related questions. Built using Gradio, NLTK, and scikit-learn, it provides an engaging user experience through a visually appealing and responsive interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

The chatbot preprocesses both the predefined questions and user input using NLP techniques. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to identify the most relevant question from its knowledge base. If the similarity score is above a set threshold, it returns the corresponding answer. Otherwise, it politely asks the user to rephrase.
