# üöÄ Advanced YOLOv8 Object Tracker GUI

A **real-time**, **high-performance** object detection and tracking application powered by **YOLOv8** and designed with a sleek GUI using **Tkinter**.

This project allows you to detect and track multiple objects live from a webcam or video file, assign them unique IDs, and visualize their movement paths interactively.
