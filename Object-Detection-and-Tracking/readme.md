üöÄ Advanced YOLOv8 Object Tracker GUI

A real-time, high-performance object detection and tracking application built with YOLOv8 and a feature-rich graphical user interface created using Python's Tkinter.

This project provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to perform object detection on either a live webcam feed or a pre-recorded video file. It tracks detected objects across frames, assigning a unique ID and visualizing their path.

‚ú® Features

üìπ Real-Time Detection & Tracking: Processes video feeds live to detect and track multiple objects simultaneously.

üéØ Unique Object ID & Path: Each detected object is assigned a persistent ID and its movement trail is visualized on screen.

‚ú® Modern & Interactive UI: A sleek, dark-themed interface built with Tkinter and ttkthemes, providing a superior user experience.

üéõÔ∏è Real-Time Control Panel:

Adjust the detection confidence threshold on the fly with a slider.

Toggle bounding boxes and tracking trails with checkboxes.

Select different YOLOv8 models (n, s, m) from a dropdown menu.

üìä Live Statistics:

Monitor performance with a real-time FPS counter.

See a live count of currently tracked objects.

üé• Flexible Video Sources:

Use a live webcam feed.

Open and process any video file (.mp4, .avi, etc.).

‚èØÔ∏è Full Playback Control: Pause, Resume, and Stop the video stream. A progress bar shows the current position in a video file.

4. Download a YOLOv8 model
You need to have at least one YOLOv8 model weight file in the project directory. You can download the default yolov8n.pt from the Ultralytics repository. Place the .pt file in the same folder as your Python script.

3. Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, run the main script from your terminal:

Generated bash
python your_script_name.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file.)

üìñ How to Use the Application

Select a Model: Choose a YOLOv8 model from the dropdown menu before starting.

Choose a Source:

Click ‚ñ∂ Start Webcam to use your computer's default camera.

Click üìÇ Open Video File to select a video from your computer.

Adjust Settings Live:
